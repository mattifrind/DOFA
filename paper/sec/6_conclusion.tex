As we have seen, the DOFA model can be used to analyze the Sentinel-1 from the BigEarthNet dataset. The features from the model contain the semantic information necessary to train a classifier to predict the related class labels. However, the model struggles to provide high-quality features for classes with low availability, which leads to mediocre classification performance and doesn't keep up to the state-of-the-art.
