\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

The images of the BigEarthNet are being fed through the DOFA model and the feature vectors are used for further analysis like UMAP visualization and training data for downstream tasks. The approach relies on PyTorch (DOFA execution, classifier training), scikit-learn (classifier training, metrics), and a Python implementation of the UMAP visualization.
