\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

The images from BigEarthNet are fed through the DOFA model, and the resulting feature vectors are used for further analysis, such as UMAP visualization and as training data for downstream tasks. The approach relies on PyTorch (for DOFA execution and classifier training), scikit-learn (for classifier training and metrics), and a Python implementation of UMAP.
