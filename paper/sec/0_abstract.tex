\begin{abstract}
Large language models have shown impressive performance gains for various tasks in language processing in the last few years \cite{minaee2024largelanguagemodelssurvey}.
It is reasonable to think that it is possible to overcome some of the problems in remote sensing image processing, like scarcity of labeled data, with the help of foundational vision models.

In this work, we provide an evaluation of the DOFA model \cite{dofa} when used on the BigEarthNet dataset \cite{clasen2024rebenrefinedbigearthnetdataset}.
This includes an analysis of the feature vectors and different approaches for using these features for multi-label classification.

We've seen reasonable performances across different metrics but no improvement compared to other models trained on BigEarthNet \cite{bigearthnet}.
