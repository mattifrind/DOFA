\begin{abstract}
Large language models have shown impressive performance gains for various tasks in language processing over the last few years.
It is reasonable to think that some of the problems in remote sensing image processing, such as scarcity of labeled data, can be overcome with the help of foundational vision models.

In this work, we provide an evaluation of the \textbf{DOFA} model when using the BigEarthNet dataset.
This includes an analysis of the feature vectors, as well as different approaches for using these features in multi-label classification.

We've seen reasonable performances across different metrics but no improvement compared to other models trained on BigEarthNet.
